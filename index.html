                <h4>Beef Rendang</h4>
                <h5>Rendang is a West Sumatran specialty, consisting mainly of thick beef dices slowly cooked for several hours in a blend of coconut milk and spices. 
                    The process alternates between boiling and frying as some of the liquid evaporates until the gravy dries up and is well absorbed into the meat. 
                    The result is super tender and juicy pieces of meat, with the reduced gravy alone a wonderful treat to be mixed with rice, which is typically served on the sides.</h5>

                <h5>There are many variations of satay across the archipelago, either in the meat used or the accompanying sauces. Generally, 
                    satay is made by first marinating uniform-sized chunks of beef, mutton, chicken, pork or fish with spices and seasoning, 
                    before skewering the pieces and then grilling them over hot charcoal. Most of the times, it is served with hot and spicy peanut chilli sauce,
                     pieces of cucumber, shallots, and rice or slices of lontong or ketupat rice cakes on the side.</h5>

                    The meatballs can be of any meat, from beef, chicken to fish and even pork. Sizes also vary, from small marbles to tennis balls!</h5>

                    A serving generally consists of slices of oxtail (usually fried but in most cases grilled), in a clear broth that is infused with shallots, garlic, pepper, nutmeg and cloves. 
                    Presentations vary widely, but mostly include boiled potatoes, carrots, tomatoes, leek, celery, and fried shallots. A slice of lime to be squeezed over the bowl, chilli sauce and plate of steamed white rice usually accompanies the dish.</h5>

                    The ‘flattened’ bit mostly refers to it being served squashed down onto a bed of spicy sambal. The sambal chilli sauce is the main draw among Indonesians who like their meals hot. 
                    It is commonly served with plain steamed rice, freshly picked vegetables and fried bean curd or tahu and tempeh.</h5>
