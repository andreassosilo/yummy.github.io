                        <h5>Rendang is a West Sumatran specialty, consisting mainly of thick beef dices slowly cooked for several hours in a blend of coconut milk and spices. 
                            The process alternates between boiling and frying as some of the liquid evaporates until the gravy dries up and is well absorbed into the meat. 
                            The result is super tender and juicy pieces of meat, with the reduced gravy alone a wonderful treat to be mixed with rice, which is typically served on the sides.</h5>
